ingewikkeld/rest-user-bundle
============================

Bundle with some default configurations for use with friendsofsymfony/user-bundle. This code was originally part of the [Resourceful](http://github.com/ingewikkeld/resourceful) project. It was moved
to a seperate library to allow the inclusion of this code in other codebases than Resourceful, and to split logic
from configuration.
